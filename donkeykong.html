        <h3>How it Utilizes Switch 2 Features</h3>
        <img src = "dkArtist.webp" alt = "DK Artist Mode Sculpture" width = 500 class = content-image>
        <p>While the main story could have worked as a Switch 1 game (and was in fact originally
            developed for that system), the DK Artist mode allows players to sculpt various
            creations using the Switch 2's mouse controls. Furthermore, side-by-side footage
            straight from Nintendo shows that when compared to the original version of the game
            on Switch 1, the Switch 2 version benefits from improved lighting, higher quality
            assets, and a more detailed environment.
