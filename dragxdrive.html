        <h3>Synopsis</h3>
        <img src = "dragxdrive.png" alt = "Drag and Drive box art" width = 500 class = content-image>
        <p>Have you ever wondered what it would be like to play a wheelchair basketball game
            where you hold a controller in each hand and push and pull them along a surface,
            as if you were steering an actual wheelchair? You probably haven't, but Nintendo
            is here to give you what you didn't know you needed. Steer your character around
            the court as you play 3 on 3 basketball against bots or other players online.
            In between rounds, you can participate in minigames with the other players or win 
            trophies from various challenges around the park. Use motion controls to wave your
            arms around and either congratulate or taunt other players, depending on how
            you're feeling!

        <h3>How it Utilizes Switch 2 Features</h3>
        <img src = "playerShooting.jpg" alt = "Player Shooting Basket and Joy-Con 2 Controller on Flast Surface" width = 500 class = content-image>
        <p>How doesn't it? This game was designed specifically with the Switch 2 in mind,
            and it would not be feasible without the Joy-Con 2 controllers. Drag x Drive is
            seen by many as a tech demo that showcases a new type of gameplay that the mouse
            controls make possible. And while tech demos may often lack polish, Drag x Drive
            proves it doesn't need anything more than the satisfaction of pushing and
            pulling to be an enjoyable experience for only $20.
