        <h1>An Intro to the Nintendo Switch 2</h1>
        <p id = "unique">The Nintendo Switch 2 is the newest gaming console from "the Big N," released
            worldwide on June 5, 2025. While easy to dismiss as a slightly upgraded Switch
            that isn't worth forking over $450 for, the console actually does include a number
            of new features without distracting from what made the first Switch great.
