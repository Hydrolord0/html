        <p>Oh, <i>come on</i>. It's the first Metroid Prime game in 18 years, developed by
            the same team that did the original trilogy. What more do you need to know? Join
            bounty hunter Samas Aran as she explores the mysterious planet Viewros. Find out
            the motives of the mysterious Lamorn race and finally take on the vengeful Sylux
            when Metroid Prime 4: Beyond releases on both Switch and Switch 2 on December 4!

        <h3>How it Utilizes Switch 2 Features</h3>
        <img src = "graphics.jpg" alt = "Switch vs Switch 2 graphics comparison" width = 500 class = content-image>
        <p>While the game will also be released for the original Switch, the Switch 2 version
            of the game will feature mouse controls, allowing you to aim and fire with great
            precision by moving the Joy-Con 2 controller around. Also, in a series well known
            for its stunning visuals, it's important to have powerful hardware. The Switch 2
            version of the game will feature both a Quality Mode and a Performance Mode. Quality
            Mode will allow for 4K at 60fps in docked mode, while Performance Mode will allow
            for 1080p at 120fps in docked mode. Needless to say, that would not be possible on
            a regular Switch.
